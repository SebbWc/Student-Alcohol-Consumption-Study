# CS Group Project
Simply: A C++ project designed to look into student alcohol consumption.

Explicitly: We will use two csv files to create an explorative data analysis (EDA) of alcoholism in students as well as some of the characteristics that could accompany a student who drinks. We will create a menu driven system that could allow for a user to pick between simple data like gender distribution, or overall alcohol use as well as more intricate data implications like scholastic level, parents education level/parents relationship status.
